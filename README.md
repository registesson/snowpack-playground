Snowpack learning playground

See [Snowpack home page](https://www.snowpack.dev) for details.

This branch builds a Cockpit plugin. This can't use the dev server, the generated files need to be served through cockpit-ws. So this uses watch mode instead.

Run this with:

    npm install
    npm run watch
